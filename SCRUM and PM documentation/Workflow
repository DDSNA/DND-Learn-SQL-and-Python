Proposed workflow (1 week):
E-SEK- 8 hours solo - learning + experimenting with new tools + SQL shenanigans
DAN - 4 hours solo - PM + SQL shenanigans + learning about statistic models and maths we will need + implementing

Minimum 2 hours of collaborative work + 1 weekly stand-up (yes, we will be standing up while doing this)

This is about as initial as it can be and will probably suffer major changes
